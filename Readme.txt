Touchit is a balloon bursting game, specially designed for toddlers. It's background sound as well as balloon
bursting sound , makes it more tempting.

As the game starts , player has 10 secs to burst 70 balloons , after each 10 secs , level of the game  increases, as
the number of balloon left unburst in last rounds , gets added up to the new round, it won't be visible on the screen ,
but it's there on the background.

So more the number of balloons a player left in a round ,  more the level of game increases.
